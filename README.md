# Semiconductor diode

A diode is a two-terminal element, usually made by using a p-n junction (the operation of which is
explained in detail in ROBT204 class).
The symbol for a diode is shown in Fig.1 (a). Which terminal is which matters very much in a diode.
Usually, the terminal indicated by a horizontal line in Fig. 1 (a), called the cathode, is marked on a real
diode; see, for example, Fig. 1(b). We define the voltage (vD) and the current (iD) of a diode as shown in
the figure. These two quantities are related, as shown in Fig. 1(c). When the 2 voltage vD is positive, the
diode is said to be forward-biased; a large current can then flow, and the diode is said to conduct. When
the voltage vD is negative, the diode is said to be reverse-biased; the diode current is extremely small, and
for our purposes it is assumed to be zero; the diode is then said to be turned off. Thus, the diode
effectively conducts current in only one direction (downward in Fig. 1); it “refuses” to conduct current in
the other direction. This property turns out to be very useful, as you will find out in this experiment.
